    Strings are defined as an array of characters.
    The difference between a character array and
    a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.

    Below are some examples of strings:
    “geeks”, “for”, “geeks”, “GeeksforGeeks”, “Geeks for Geeks”, “123Geeks”, “@123 Geeks”

    // How String is represented in Memory?

    /*
     In C, a string can be referred to either using a character pointer
     or as a character array. When strings are declared as character
     arrays, they are stored like other types of arrays in C.
     For example, if str[] is an auto variable then the string
     is stored in the stack segment, if it’s a global or
     static variable then stored in the data segment, etc.
